music is what regulates our emotions, helps us focus, helps us get through a loss or break up, helps us celebrate a win, motivates us to get through a tough workout, helps us go to sleep, meditate...

what if the best way to silence the mind was not to scroll on social media and go through loneliness by yourself?

infinite feed of non-repetitive musical dopamine can silence the mind!

ideally, the best music playlist is the one that we never have to skip or pause a track. it just knows your mind so well

music is our best friend so let's make it perfect and infinite..

currently we are limited by the songs that we like and it's hard to find the next song that we do like.. music should be generated on the spot fully personalised based on the individual

our mind constantly looks for change but a slight change, not too much away from its comfortable predictable and nostalgic rhythm, melodies and harmonies

sometimes even a few minutes of silence or zero-complex brown background noise is needed... existing solutions are still repetitive and annoying..

I'm building this...
